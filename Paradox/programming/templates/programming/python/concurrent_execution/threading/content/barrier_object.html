        Barrier Object

        Barrier provide's a simple synchronization primitive for use by a fixed number of threads that need for wait for each other. A <i>Barrier</i> establishes a control point, and all participating threads then block untill all of the participating "parties" have reached that point. With this approach, threads can start up separately and then pause until they are all ready to proceed.

        import threading,time 

        def worker(barrier):

            worker_id=barrier.wait()
            print(threading.current_thread().name,'after barrier',worker_id)

            threading.Thread(
                name='worker-%s' % i,
                target=worker,
                args=(barrier,),
            )
            for i in range(NUM_THREADS)
        ]

            print(t.name,'starting')
            t.start()

    <p class="m-3 text-secondary">
        In this example, the <i>Barrier</i> is configured to block until three threads are waiting. When the condition is met, all of the threads are released past the control point at the same time. The return value from wait() indicates the number of party being released, and can be used to limit some threads from taking an action such as cleaning up a shared resource.

        This example configures the Barrier to expect one more participating thread than is actually started so that processing is all of the threads is blocked. The <i>abort()</i> call raises an exception in each blocked thread.
