    <p class="m-3 text-secondary">
        multiprocessing is a package that spawn process using an API. The multiprocessing package offers both local and remote concurrency, effectively side-stepping the <i>Global Interpreter Lock</i> by using subprocesses instead of threads. Due to this, the multiprocessing module allows the programmer to fully leverage multiple processors on a given machine.
